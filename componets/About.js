      Redux is a state management library commonly used with React applications to manage the application's state in a predictable way.
       It provides a centralized store to hold the state of your entire application and a set of rules to follow when updating that state.
        The core principles of Redux include:
<h2>Single Source of Truth:</h2>
<p>Redux stores the entire state of your application in a single JavaScript object called the "store." This makes it easy to understand and manage the state of your application, as there is only one source of truth.
</p>
<h2>State is Read-Only:</h2>
<p>The state in Redux is read-only, meaning you cannot directly modify the state. Instead, you dispatch actions to describe changes to the state. These actions are processed by pure functions called reducers, which specify how the state should change in response to the action.
</p>
<p>Changes are Made with Pure Functions (Reducers):
Reducers are pure functions that take the current state and an action as arguments and return a new state. They are responsible for specifying how the state should change in response to an action.

Predictable State Changes:
By enforcing a unidirectional data flow and using pure functions to handle state changes, Redux ensures predictable and traceable state changes. This makes it easier to debug and reason about the state of your application.

Actions:
Actions are plain JavaScript objects that describe an intention to change the state. They have a type property that indicates the type of action and may include additional data.

Reducers:
Reducers are pure functions that specify how the state should change in response to actions. They take the current state and an action as arguments and return a new state.

Store:
The store holds the application state, allows access to the state via getState(), allows state to be updated via dispatch(action), and provides a way to subscribe to changes in the state.

Middleware:
Middleware provides a way to extend the behavior of Redux. It sits between the dispatching of an action and the moment it reaches the reducer, allowing you to perform additional tasks such as logging, async operations, etc.
